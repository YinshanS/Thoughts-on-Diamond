## Contents:
1. [Thoughts on simplified diamond model.ipynb](https://github.com/YinshanS/Thoughts-on-Diamond/blob/master/Thoughts%20on%20simplified%20diamond%20model.ipynb) stores the basic setup of the project and some ideas from Prof. Waldmann.
1. [Notes on Diamond Model special Cases.ipynb](https://github.com/YinshanS/Thoughts-on-Diamond/blob/master/Notes%20on%20Diamond%20Model%20special%20cases.ipynb) discusses the model under two special circumstances: log utility and quasi-linear utility.
2. [log utility risk-free rate.ipynb](https://github.com/YinshanS/Thoughts-on-Diamond/blob/master/Log%20Utility%20Risk%20Free%20Rate.ipynb) provides calculation of risk-free rates assuming log utility.
3. [Discussion on Debt Blowup.ipynb](https://github.com/YinshanS/Thoughts-on-Diamond/blob/master/Discussion%20on%20Debt%20Blowup.ipynb) provides discussion on the feasibility of the policy of increasing government debt to achieve pareto improvement. 
4. Folder _mathematica_ stores attempts to solve systems of equations required by the economic setup and get explicit formula for variables of concern.
5. [scratch simplest case utility wo debt.pdf](https://github.com/YinshanS/Thoughts-on-Diamond/blob/master/scratch%20simplest%20case%20utility%20wo%20debt.pdf) stores handwritten scratch linked from notebooks above. It is uploaded for reference and convenience when looking for mistakes.
