However, Rf is not what it would be -- it has to be higher given R in order to convince people to hold D not zero safe asset.  This is messy *except* in the case of logarithmic utility. For logarithmic utility, this and everything related to interest rates and returns has no effect on saving.

The idea is that there is a slightly stronger result if E(ln(Rf))<0 and the policy is to give bonds to generation 1 then roll them over until the debt vanishes.
