I add to this Summers thought about shocks which affect R but not K (simplest way to model them is capital biased technology shocks) .  Here I think one way forward (which I haven't really done beyond some FREDing) is empirical.  In fact labor's share is countercyclical. An asset which paid x% of wages would be safer than equity.  The long list of possible explanations is relevant but it will be hard to tell which matters. The point is that this means that the welfare effects of debt through W and R depend on an interest rate far below the return on equities.\n",

    "a) OK the data are tricky because one has to decide how literally to take the OLG model. Are time periods really generations or is the OLG model used to model short planning horizons due to bounded rationality ?  I think the second interpretation is the one which will be fruitful, some time, years or decades from now, when macroeconomists get over the now decades long rational expectations fad.  But here we are in the present where the Diamond OLG model is semi forgotten and exotic, and an interpretation of it based on saying people are obviously boundedly rational will not be allowed.\n",
    "\n",
    "But I still think simple calculations about how yes indeed the share of labor is countercyclical would be useful as motivation.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Summers. This is the simplest and most standard approach.  It works fine if we just say that technology shocks aren't Hicks neutral (no reason for them to be) and are instead capital biased. Summers's own thought about how the risk is variable price of claims on K not variable revenue allows too much reality to get involved.  I'm sure this is what's going on.  It brings us back to Noise Trader Risk in financial markets (1990)..  For present purposes it creates trouble, because a variable price of K has complicated effects in an OLG model. The complicated effects are that the price of capital in time t will affect (real) investment at time t.   I guess there might be a knife age exception.  So W varies because K varies even if asset price shocks (noise) doesn't affect W directly.  This becomes a tricky model to analyse. It might be interesting.\n",

    " Here it is important that the model does *not* have a safe asset or storage technology.  If there is a safe asset, then D crowds out that safe asset and it-s sort of obvious that welfare effects depend only on Rf-(1+g).  Actually writing this out might be worthwhile.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) yeah why can't we assume a storage technology ?  Goods are stored in the real world. There are, in fact, assets which aren't sovereign debt and which are fairly safe (AAA bonds).  They are the assets which should be crowded out by D.  A model with a safe asset other than D is trivially simpl.  This is a good thing, because it is more realistic and much easier to solve..  I think the fact that the paper basically becomes a sequel to Delong et al 1990 and even more so Delong et al 1989 (size and incidence) is another good thing.  I would dust off the old model.  \n",

    "e) idiosyncratic risk which matters for the risky return R.  This was my original idea.  I think working on this assuming full rationality is silly.  I think some hand waving about principal agent reasons that risk can't be diversified is OK, but the main point is that own risk is priced  CAPM fails Reality. Data.  The useful point is that whatever risk causes the return on stock to be very high is not relevant to policy makers.  The case for debt and or socialism was proven by Mehra and Prescott (additional bonus \"public ownership of the means of production is efficient as proven by Prescott\" would be really fun to write).  A problem is that this is the point Quiggin has been making for decades.  \n",

The only problem is that D *might* become very large for a while. I say, more complicated policy where, if D is greater than some threshold, use taxes to reduce it. This means there is  a chance that the policy isn't a Pareto improvement.  For any epsilon >0, there is a policy of this type which causes a Pareto improvement with probability greater than 1-epsilon.\n",

    "4. Another stronger result which doesn't depend on Rf alone.  So long as the geometric mean of R_t is greater than Rf_t for every t, a sovereign carry trade in which the state sells bonds and buys risky assets is good.  Conveniently the distribution of R_t and the value of Rf_t both depend in the same way on K_(t-1) so it is easy for the inequality to be E(ln(R_t))>ln(Rf_t) for every t.  I think if u is a CES utility function, the condidition is that the elasticity of substitution < 2.  in other words if u is a constant relative risk aversion utility function, the inequality holds so long as the coefficient of relative risk aversion is greater than 0.5.\n",

    "In this case, again, the idea is roll it over using taxes and transfers on capital and labor income to keep R and W what they would have been with laissez faire. Again this means all benefit because Rf is greater (also see by revealed preference -- agents choose to buy the debt they aren't forced to buy it).\n",

    "Again bad luck might mean that state must tax to avoid bankruptcy.  Again for any epsilon, there is a policy of this form such that the chance it has to tax is less than epsilon.\n",

    "I think a good twist is to pay back the debt as soon as the state's net wealth is positive. then use the sovereign wealth fund to pay subsidies and get K to the Ramsey Cass Koopmans level not the Diamond steady state level.  This implies welfare gains which can be very large even if initial D is very small.  \n",

    "There is no doubt in my mind that this should be done in the real world.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we could also introduce noise traders and try to rope Summers in.  I have noticed that a solution for Noise Trader risk is a sovereign wealth fund (or carry trade).\n"

The idea is that there is a slightly stronger result if E(ln(Rf))<0 and the policy is to give bonds to generation 1 then roll them over until the debt vanishes.
